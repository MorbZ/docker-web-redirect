This Docker container listens on port 80 and redirects all web traffic permanently to the given target domain/URL.

## Features ##
- Lightweight: Uses only ~2 MB RAM on Linux
- Keeps the URL path and GET parameters
- Permanent (HTTP 301) or Temporary (HTTP 302) redirect

## Usage ##
### Docker run ###
The target domain/URL is set by the `REDIRECT_TARGET` environment variable.  
Possible redirect targets include domains (`mydomain.net`), paths (`mydomain.net/my_page`) or specific protocols (`https://mydomain.net/my_page`).  

**Example:** `$ docker run --rm -d -e REDIRECT_TARGET=mydomain.net -p 80:80 morbz/docker-web-redirect`

### Paths are retained ###
The URL path and GET parameters are retained. That means that a request to `http://myolddomain.net/index.php?page=2` will be redirected to `http://mydomain.net/index.php?page=2` when `REDIRECT_TARGET=mydomain.net` is set.

### Permanent redirects ###
Redirects are permanent (HTTP status code 301). That means browsers will cache the redirect and will go directly to the new site on further requests. Also search engines will recognize the new domain and change their URLs. This means this image is not suitable for temporary redirects e.g. for site maintenance.

### Temporary redirects ###
Redirects are temporary and not cached (HTTP status code 302). To use a temporary redirect, add the env variable `TEMPORARY=1`

## Docker Compose ##
This image can be combined with the [jwilder nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/). A sample docker-compose file that redirects `myolddomain.net` to `mydomain.net` could look like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  redirect:
    image: morbz/docker-web-redirect
    restart: always
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=myolddomain.net
      - REDIRECT_TARGET=mydomain.net
```
